# E-xtraction

Basic Tumblr Image Scrapper in Python

> "Because Tumblr is Missing an E"  
> Narcolle the Wise

## Motivation
I wrote this program for fun after hearing about Tumblr's decision to make itself obsolete on Dec 17th, 2018.  
With inspiration from my friend Narcolle, I decided to write a program that could be used to save your memories before Tumblr commits business suicide. 

While some people have good understanding of technology, I assume Tumblr's decision will affect variety of people, even the ones who do not have deep understanding of how programming works. 

My Goal is to create a program that everyone can use relatively easily. As I said, **this program is written for one Narcolle, and for every single one of the digital nomads seeking refuge out there.**
